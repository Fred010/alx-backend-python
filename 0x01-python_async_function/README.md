# Python - Async

### Introduction
This _README_ provides an overview of asynchronous programming in Python, using the async and await keywords. Asynchronous programming allows you to perform non-blocking operations, making your code more efficient and responsive, especially when dealing with I/O-bound tasks like network requests and database operations.

### Key Concepts
* Coroutines: Functions that can be suspended and resumed at specific points.
* Event Loop: A mechanism that schedules and executes coroutines.
async and await Keywords: Used to define and call asynchronous functions.

## Basic Usage
### Define an asynchronous function:
```
async def my_async_function():
    # Asynchronous operations here
    result = await some_async_operation()
    return result
```

### Call the asynchronous function:
```
import asyncio

async def main():
    result = await my_async_function()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Network Requests:
```
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:   

            return await response.text()

async def main():
    results   
 = await asyncio.gather(
        fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data1"),
        fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data2")
    )
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Database Operations:
```
import asyncio
import aiopg

async def query_database(query):
    async with aiopg.connect(dsn="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database") as conn:
        async with conn.cursor() as cur:
            await cur.execute(query)
            rows = await cur.fetchall()
            return rows
```
#### ... (similar to network requests example)


### Best Practices
* Use asyncio for I/O-bound tasks.
* Avoid blocking operations within coroutines.
* Handle exceptions appropriately.
* Consider using libraries like aiohttp and aiopg for common tasks.

### Additional Notes
For more complex asynchronous operations, explore libraries like asyncpg, aioredis, and aiogram.
Python 3.7 introduced the async/await syntax, making asynchronous programming more concise and readable.
